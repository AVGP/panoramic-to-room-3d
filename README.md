# Room Constructor
## Simplistic 3D room reconstruction from panoramic images

## Preface

This tool uses the algorithm described in the "RECONSTRUCTING VIRTUAL ROOMS FROM PANORAMIC IMAGES" paper by
Dirk Farin and Peter H. N. de With.

It allows the user to upload a panoramic image (i.e. a 360Â° image of a room), mark the room's corners and then presents the image
mapped onto a rectangular, virtual 3D room with correct proportions.
